I work with James to connect to the community and work with the notebook. I have always loved building things and working with my hands, especially when engineering is involved. While I work with things not involving the robot, I still love building and continue to work on the robot as a sudo member of the Build team.",

Over last summer I volunteered at GEMS camp at the Natick Soldier Service Center, Army Labs, in Natick where I taught and set up experiments for 4th and 5th graders to learn science and have fun. When I got into high school I joined robotics to stimulate my engineering drive. I love coding and building things.",
